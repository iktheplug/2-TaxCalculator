## Getting Started

Welcome to a simple Tax Calculator program written in Java.
The program takes the user input of staff name and salary and based on the tax condition
the application is able to calculate the tax and show the class the staff belongs to

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
For this project, the bin folder will be ignored.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
